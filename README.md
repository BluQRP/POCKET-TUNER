A Tiny QRP(p) T-Match Antenna Tuner for Portable, SOTA and POTA operations.

POCKET TUNER is a T-Match highly minituarized portable anteanna tuner for HF Bands.

Specs and aspects of this tiny pocket tuner:
--------------------------------------------
-	Works on HF Bands from 6m to 80m. 

-	Can tune up to 5 watts though main design aim was to work in QRPp zone which is sub 1 watt! Though I successfully used it with my ADX, QDX and QMX without any issues by keeping tuning TX times under 10 seconds at a time not to heat up excessively. Then it works like a champ! ðŸ˜Š

-	It has a resistive tuning process indicator which is similar to any resistive tuner meaning does not stress your TRX in tuning mode by lowering SWR in tuning to 2 or lower. This is great not to expose RF PA output stage to excessive SWR conditions while tuning as this is the case in Automatic Antenna Tuners.

Letâ€™s talk a bit about limitations of this tiny tuner:
-	Aimed for Sub 1 Watt QRPp operation mainly though can be used up to 5 watts by being considerate on Tune TX times.
